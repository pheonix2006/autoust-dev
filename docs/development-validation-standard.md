# Development Validation Standard

This document defines the standard workflow for development-stage runtime
validation iterations. It applies across validation assignments; DSAA2011,
UCUG1505, or any later task are targets of the same process, not special-case
workflows.

Use this standard before dispatching a runtime coordinator or validation
subagent.

## Two Flow Lines

Keep the user-facing runtime line separate from the development-validation line.
They share the same task artifacts, but they do not have the same actors.

In the real user line, the current Claude Code Main Agent is the runtime Main
Agent. It reads `skill.md`, routes to the public `do-homework` task, lets
`do-homework.md` perform router/preflight/route selection, then follows the
selected first-stage runtime file. Clean starts use `background-recon.md` for
background recon plus source confirmation. Retained, repair, and continue starts
use `existing-work-recon.md` for current work/state recon. The first-stage file
then reveals `alignment-planning.md`, which owns alignment and pipeline
planning before `task-orchestrator.md` executes an approved plan.

In the development-validation line, the current session is Main Agent A: an
outer test harness, not the runtime coordinator being tested. A prepares a
clean launch state, shows the startup inventory to the human reviewer, dispatches
a fresh runtime coordinator B, bridges live simulated-user answers when the run
reaches `[B]`, exports transcripts after B stops, and dispatches D/E reviewers.
B must still behave like the real user-facing Main Agent and must use only the
runtime surface named in the launch boundary. A's development analysis,
expectations, and hidden diagnoses are not runtime context for B.

For `[B]` alignment-loop validation, use this bridge rule:

1. B asks the next single alignment question.
2. A forwards that question to the human reviewer without improving it,
   answering for the user, or bundling extra context.
3. The human reviewer answers as the simulated end user. If they also need to
   give development instructions to A, prefix them with `[DEV]`; A must not
   forward `[DEV]` content to B as user intent.
4. A forwards only the simulated user's answer back to B.
5. B appends `investigation/user_notes.md` for every round and writes
   `investigation/alignment_brief.md` only when it has no necessary alignment
   question left.
6. A forwards B's final brief summary to the human reviewer for confirmation.
   Only after the reviewer confirms may B enter `[C]`.

This lets development testing exercise the real `alignment-planning.md`
alignment behavior reached through the `do-homework.md` router without letting
the outer developer session pre-solve the alignment problem.

When the run uses a live simulated user instead of a fully specified startup
prompt, the coordinator prompt must require an explicit pause protocol:

- When B needs a user answer, it returns the exact question plus
  `WAITING_FOR_SIMULATED_USER_B_ROUND_<N>` and does not continue to `[C]`.
- A forwards the question to the human reviewer and sends B only:
  `SIMULATED_USER_ANSWER_B_ROUND_<N>: <answer>`.
- B appends the round to `investigation/user_notes.md`, then either asks the
  next single question with the next waiting marker or writes
  `investigation/alignment_brief.md`.
- When B writes the terminal brief, it returns a concise brief summary plus
  `WAITING_FOR_ALIGNMENT_BRIEF_CONFIRMATION`.
- A forwards the summary to the human reviewer and sends B only
  `SIMULATED_USER_ALIGNMENT_CONFIRMATION: confirmed` or
  `SIMULATED_USER_ALIGNMENT_CORRECTION: <correction>`.
- If B receives a correction, it appends another `user_notes.md` round, replaces
  `alignment_brief.md`, and waits for confirmation again.

For a non-interactive validation run, all simulated user supplements must be in
the launch prompt or accepted startup inventory. Even then, B should still write
`user_notes.md` and `alignment_brief.md`; the test simply does not exercise the
live multi-round bridge.

## Entry Presets And Unified Flow

Before dispatching any runtime coordinator, the Main Agent must declare the
entry preset and the startup inventory. Legacy validation names are still
allowed, but they are presets for the same unified flow:

- `full_flow` maps to `entry_preset: clean_start`. The startup inventory has no
  retained user-visible draft. The coordinator normally enables source/spec
  exploration, then runs alignment, planning, execution, review, verification,
  and final receipts.
- `repair_flow` maps to `entry_preset: retained_artifact_start`. The startup
  inventory includes current user-visible artifacts or prior progress that the
  user intentionally wants continued or changed. The coordinator enables only
  the additional artifact, codebase, history, or verification scouts whose inputs
  exist and affect planning.

If the user says "run the task again", "repeat the flow", or "simulate the real
user flow" without narrowing the scope, default to `entry_preset: clean_start`.
If the user asks to continue, improve, repair, polish, or revise an existing
user-visible output, use `entry_preset: retained_artifact_start`.

The previous draft is not a forbidden leak when it is the user-visible object
being continued or changed and is explicitly retained in the startup inventory.
Hidden prior diagnostics, archived validation transcripts, old trajectory
reviews, old process receipts, and unstated conclusions remain forbidden runtime
context unless they are listed as allowlisted explore-history inputs and then
distilled into current-run exploration evidence.

## Preflight Archive And No-Leak Cleanup

Before the coordinator is dispatched:

1. Archive the previous iteration's active workbench evidence under
   `archive/<iteration-id>/`.
2. Remove stale runtime evidence from the active workbench:
   `stage_briefs/`, `stage_results/`, `stage_reviews/`, `transcripts/`,
   `verification_checklist.md`, `verification.log`, `result.json`, prior
   `repair_plan.md`, prior `repair_pipeline_design.md`, coordinator identity
   sidecars, trajectory reviewer identity sidecars, and any coordinator or
   trajectory summary files.
3. Determine the retained user-visible inputs from the request and the accepted
   startup inventory. For `clean_start`, remove generated workbench content from
   the active launch directory: `canvas/`, `references/`, `investigation/`,
   `draft/`, `spec.md`, `problem.md`, and `pipeline_design.md`. These are outputs
   of the user-facing homework flow, not valid hidden startup context.
4. For `retained_artifact_start`, keep only the files that the simulated user
   would actually have available and would intentionally ask the runtime to use.
   This may include current draft artifacts, `spec.md`, `problem.md`, source
   references, source code, tests, data, metrics, rendered PDFs, slides, or local
   app assets. It normally excludes old `pipeline_design.md`, old
   `stage_briefs/`, `stage_results/`, `stage_reviews/`, `transcripts/`,
   `verification.log`, prior `repair_plan.md`, prior
   `repair_pipeline_design.md`, `investigation/review_a.json` and similar review
   receipts, identity sidecars, and old trajectory verdicts from active startup
   context; those are archived first for rollback and audit. The coordinator
   must write fresh current-run planning artifacts rather than editing or reusing
   a prior run's planning files in active root.
   If the run needs progress/history awareness, list any old
   `pipeline_design.md`, `verification.log`, `result.json`, package manifest, or
   stage-result summaries as `allowlisted_history_files` for read-only explore
   scouts. They remain archived or otherwise explicitly path-scoped; they are not
   general startup context for executor/reviewer children.
5. Do not hide user supplements in workbench files. If group id, dataset choice,
   partner names, instructor oral notes, or scope constraints are needed, pass
   them explicitly in the simulated user prompt or at the `[B]` checkpoint.
6. After cleanup, stop before coordinator dispatch and show the startup
   inventory to the human reviewer. Do not start the coordinator until the
   reviewer accepts the launch state.
7. After reviewer acceptance, write the accepted startup inventory into the
   active workbench before coordinator dispatch. Use
   `prelaunch_startup_inventory.json` for structured evidence, or
   `prelaunch_startup_inventory.txt` when preserving exact command output is
   more useful. The coordinator summary must link this artifact.

The startup inventory must include:

```bash
find data/semesters/<TERM>/courses/<COURSE>/homework/<assignment> -maxdepth 2 -type f | sort
find data/semesters/<TERM>/courses/<COURSE>/homework/<assignment> -maxdepth 2 -type d | sort
find data/semesters/<TERM>/courses/<COURSE>/homework/<assignment>/archive/<iteration-id> -maxdepth 2 -type f | sort
```

Expected for `entry_preset: clean_start`: the active workbench contains no
generated assignment materials or previous verdicts except `archive/` and any
deliberately empty parent directory. The coordinator must discover or regenerate
all runtime files through the normal public skill/task surface.

The structured inventory should include:

```json
{
  "schema": "autostudy_prelaunch_startup_inventory_v1",
  "iteration_id": "<iteration-id>",
  "declared_mode": "full_flow | repair_flow",
  "entry_preset": "clean_start | retained_artifact_start",

    ],

      "stop_conditions": ["evidence that the repair can stop"]
    }
  },
  "must_not_clean_start": true
}
```

The rollback archive is allowed for Main Agent A and post-run trajectory
reviewers. Runtime coordinator B and runtime children C must not use it as task
context unless the simulated user explicitly asks to compare against the
archived version. They should use the retained active draft files instead.

Runtime verification commands must preserve that boundary mechanically, not only
by intent. When a coordinator or child needs an active-workbench search, it
should either `cd` into the workbench and use relative paths with an explicit
archive exclusion, or use `find` with an archive prune. Do not rely on broad
absolute-path searches whose glob exclusions may fail to match nested
`archive/` paths. Safe patterns are:

```bash
cd data/semesters/<TERM>/courses/<COURSE>/homework/<assignment>
rg -n "submit|canvas" . --glob '!archive/**'

find data/semesters/<TERM>/courses/<COURSE>/homework/<assignment> \
  -path 'data/semesters/<TERM>/courses/<COURSE>/homework/<assignment>/archive' -prune -o \
  -type f -print
```

If a command exposes archive path names, record it as a process concern and
rerun the check with a pruned command. If a command exposes archive file
contents to a runtime coordinator or child, the run cannot be clean `PASS`; the
trajectory reviewer must judge whether the content influenced task decisions and
whether the verdict should drop to `PASS_WITH_CONCERNS` or `FAIL`.

## Coordinator Launch Boundary

The runtime coordinator must receive only:

- the simulated user's assignment request;
- explicit user supplements that would normally be provided at `[B]`;
- `skill.md`;
- `sub-skills/tasks/do-homework.md`;
- `sub-skills/tasks/background-recon.md` for clean-start background recon when
  the router selects that path;
- `sub-skills/tasks/existing-work-recon.md` for retained, repair, or continue
  current work/state recon when the router selects that path;
- `sub-skills/tasks/alignment-planning.md` only after the first-stage tail
  handoff reveals it;
- `sub-skills/tasks/task-orchestrator.md`;
- top-level tool contracts that a real AutoStudy runtime could progressively
  load.
- for retained-artifact starts, the accepted startup inventory and the
  explicit user-visible retained files named in that inventory.

The coordinator must not receive:

- previous iteration stage briefs, stage receipts, review receipts, trajectory
  reviews, `verification.log`, `result.json`, or coordinator summaries;
- the Main Agent's diagnosis of prior bugs such as "report has no figures" or
  "package parity failed";
- `docs/runtime-agent-protocol.md` as its primary runtime manual;
- hidden workbench files containing user supplements that were not explicitly
  surfaced in the simulated user prompt.
- archived rollback evidence as task context, unless the user explicitly asks
  for an old-version comparison.

The Main Agent and later trajectory reviewers may use internal protocol docs as
the audit standard. The runtime coordinator should experience the same public
skill/task interface a normal AutoStudy user-facing agent would load.

During a live `[B]` alignment-loop validation, the Main Agent is only the
message bridge between B and the human reviewer acting as simulated user. A must
not rewrite B's question to make it better, combine several B questions into a
batch, add hidden assignment facts, or summarize the user's answer into a more
favorable form. If the human reviewer gives mixed content, A forwards only the
simulated-user answer and keeps `[DEV]` instructions on the development side.
The coordinator's `user_notes.md` and final `alignment_brief.md` must therefore
reflect B's actual questioning and the user's actual answers, not A's preferred
interpretation of how the alignment loop should have gone.

After dispatch returns the coordinator's stable agent/thread id, the Main Agent
must provide that id to the coordinator if it was not known at initial prompt
time. The coordinator must record it in its summary and dispatch ledger. Generic
labels such as `main-thread-runtime-coordinator` are not sufficient as the only
coordinator identity in development validation evidence.

## Explore And Change-Request Contract

The coordinator must begin every run with the routed first-stage task, then
write the terminal agreement for the current request through
`alignment-planning.md`. For clean starts, `do-homework.md` routes to
`background-recon.md`, which writes `spec.md`, `problem.md`, references,
`investigation/explore_context.md`, and the source confirmation checkpoint
before tail handoff. For retained-artifact starts, `do-homework.md` routes to
`existing-work-recon.md`, which writes current-state recon artifacts such as
`investigation/repair_recon.md` before tail handoff to the planner.

For non-trivial retained-artifact or verification runs,
`existing-work-recon.md` may dispatch read-only non-source scout children with
isolated prompts, each limited to one evidence class:

- artifact scout: current user-visible artifacts and source/package state, only
  when retained artifacts exist;
- codebase scout: repository layout, dependencies, scripts, tests, and local app
  wiring, only when a runnable codebase exists;
- process history scout: only the `allowlisted_history_files` named in the
  accepted startup inventory;
- verification scout: lightweight current checks that reveal the planning
  surface, only when checks can run without doing the actual task.

For clean-start proposal/research/open-ended homework, source/spec evidence is
complete only when:

- raw Canvas snapshots include assignment, rubric, syllabus, modules,
  module-items, assignment files, pages when relevant, file metadata, and
  announcements;
- `reference_collector` has produced `references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md`;
- task-relevant Canvas-native evidence is copied verbatim under
  `references/canvas_native/`;
- announcement evidence is not a full `canvas/announcements.json` mirror:
  relevant announcements are screened and preserved one object per
  `references/canvas_native/announcement-<id-or-slug>/source.json`, with
  `REFERENCE_INDEX.md` origins such as `canvas/announcements.json#id=26545`;
- fetched PDFs include original file, extracted text, and link annotation
  manifest;
- the `reference_collector` dispatch has a
  `stage_reviews/child_dispatch_ledger.json` row with `"role":
  "reference_collector"` and either `"agent_id"` or `"transcript_handle"`;
- Main Agent `review_a.json` records `reference_collector_used: true` and
  `source_scout_pipeline_used: false`.

If `reference_collector` cannot preserve a reachable task-relevant source, B may
continue only as a recovery path. Main Agent inline recovery must be recorded as
recovery evidence, and the validation result is not clean child-isolation
evidence.

Non-source scout children are runtime children, not informal helper notes. When
B dispatches a non-source scout, it must record the dispatch in
`stage_reviews/child_dispatch_ledger.json` with role `explore_scout` and a
scout type such as `artifact`, `codebase`, `process_history`, or
`verification`. Each completed non-source scout writes a machine-readable
receipt under:

```text
investigation/_appendix/scout_receipts/<scout_type>_result.json
```

or an equivalent path listed in `investigation/explore_manifest.json`. A skipped
non-source scout must be represented in the manifest with `status: "SKIPPED"`
and a specific reason. Non-source scout prompts follow the same identity,
timestamp, transport-recovery, transcript-export, and scope-hygiene rules as
executor and reviewer children. In particular, a process-history scout may read
only the `allowlisted_history_files` named in the accepted startup inventory,
and no scout may use `archive/`, old transcripts, old trajectory reviews, or
prior diagnostics as hidden task evidence.

The coordinator or `existing-work-recon.md` consolidates scout outputs into
`investigation/explore_context.md` and `investigation/explore_manifest.json`
before the terminal agreement. For retained-artifact starts, the tool may also
write `investigation/repair_recon.md` as a compatibility summary, then the
planner reads those current-state artifacts before writing `repair_plan.md` or
`repair_pipeline_design.md`. These files are the bridge between raw inputs and
current planning: they may summarize previous decisions, passed checks, failed
checks, and known risks, but they must also label stale or forbidden context.
Runtime executor/reviewer children should receive the explore context and final
plan, not raw old logs or archived process files, unless the final plan
explicitly grants a narrow read for a stage.

When feedback or project intent is open-ended, ambiguous, or creative, the
coordinator must not collapse directly from exploration to final plan. It must
run an alignment loop through `alignment-planning.md`, bridged by A in
the same spirit as the public homework flow: ask one necessary question at a
time, wait with a clear marker such as
`WAITING_FOR_SIMULATED_USER_B_ROUND_<N>` or
`WAITING_FOR_REPAIR_ALIGNMENT_ROUND_<N>`, record the forwarded answer in
current-run notes, and continue only until it can plan without guessing intent.
If enough context exists to avoid questions, the coordinator may write the
terminal agreement immediately, but it must say why no alignment round was
needed.

For non-trivial work, the coordinator should compare 2-3 approaches when
meaningful, then preview a scope/design skeleton before finalizing the terminal
agreement. A must forward the simulated user's choice or confirmation instead
of rewriting the coordinator's proposal. The final agreement, whether
`investigation/alignment_brief.md` or `repair_plan.md`, must include selected
approach, alternatives considered when relevant, retained and forbidden context,
changed targets, unchanged targets, scope/design skeleton, verification gates,
and stop conditions. Before dispatching children, the coordinator self-reviews
the agreement for placeholders, contradictions, scope creep, and unresolved
ambiguity that would change stage design.

The coordinator must then write a current-run execution plan. `pipeline_design.md`
and `repair_pipeline_design.md` are compatibility names for the same stage
schema. Old pipeline files are rollback/archive evidence, not active startup
context, unless the simulated user explicitly asks to inspect them or they are
read by an allowlisted history scout and distilled into explore context. The
execution plan must declare task-specific stages that cover:

- diagnosis/exploration follow-up only when the explore context says more
  inspection is needed;
- execution: modify or create only justified files, generated artifacts,
  behavior, or deliverables;
- verification: rerun the checks needed by the touched artifacts, such as tests,
  renders, notebook execution, browser checks, PDF checks, package checks, data
  validation, or other task-relevant gates;
- review: verify that the user request was addressed without regressing
  previously passing deliverable gates.

Each delegated stage still uses child subagents and the normal
executor/spec-reviewer/quality-reviewer pattern. Child briefs must identify
which current artifacts are allowed task context and which prior evidence
classes remain forbidden. A child may read and edit current files that are in
the retained startup list or generated in the current run; it must not read the
rollback archive, old transcripts, old stage reviews, or prior trajectory
verdicts as hidden answers.

If a retained-artifact change is broad enough to create a new version, the
coordinator must state whether it edits the current output in place or creates a
versioned output such as `draft_v2/`, and must preserve enough provenance for
reviewers to distinguish the old retained artifact from the new candidate.

## Nested Transcript Evidence Roles

Task 10 validates a nested execution and nested review chain, not just whether
the Main Agent can inspect files after the run:

```text
Main Agent A
  -> runtime coordinator B
      -> pre-alignment explore scout children C1, C2...
      -> execution/review child agents C3, C4...

After B finishes:

Main Agent A
  -> exports B/C transcript evidence for every runtime child by the runtime-appropriate mechanism
  -> dispatches trajectory review coordinator D
      -> D audits B's coordinator trajectory
      -> D dispatches transcript-auditor child agents E1, E2, E3...
          -> each E audits exactly one C transcript body, including scout transcripts
```

The coordinator B is the authority for child identity because B receives the
child dispatch return values. B must therefore preserve every child `agent_id`
or stable transcript handle in `child_dispatch_ledger.json`, including
superseded attempts and any descendants if a child was allowed to dispatch its
own child. The Main Agent A must not rely on search to discover missing nested
threads. It must use the propagated ids from B's ledger.

`child_dispatch_ledger.json` has a single writer: the coordinator that owns the
dispatch return value. Runtime children C must not create, append, rewrite, or
normalize the ledger. A child may write only its assigned scout result, stage
result/review receipt, and declared draft outputs. If a child transcript shows ledger writes,
the coordinator must preserve the polluted entry as evidence, mark it
`superseded_not_counted` or `rejected_child_side_ledger_write`, dispatch a
replacement if needed, and record a process concern. A clean Task 10 `PASS`
requires no child-side ledger writes.

For ordinary `spawn_agent` validation, transport failures are a first-class
state, not an informal excuse. If `wait_agent` returns `not_found`, a stream
disconnect, or another transport error after a child was dispatched, the
coordinator must perform the same recovery check before accepting the child:

1. The expected receipt exists and parses as strict JSON.
2. The local session JSONL for the child id exists or direct-parent transcript
   export exists.
3. The transcript or exported body contains the child assignment prompt.
4. The transcript or receipt evidence supports the claimed final status.
5. The receipt identity can be reconciled to the coordinator dispatch id.

Only then may the ledger status be `accepted_with_transport_recovery`. Missing
receipt evidence, missing transcript evidence, or unsupported final-status
claims require a replacement child or `BLOCKED`. Any
`accepted_with_transport_recovery` entry is a process concern; a clean `PASS`
requires no transport recovery entries.

Child receipt identity must not use role aliases such as `C4`,
`C4-spec-review`, or `current child`. If the child knows its exact runtime
`agent_id`, it writes that value. If it does not know the id at write time, it
must write `agent_id: null`, `agent_id_source:
"unknown_to_child_at_write_time"`, and `identity_authority:
"stage_reviews/child_dispatch_ledger.json"`. The coordinator may then add
`coordinator_authoritative_agent_id`, `identity_normalized_by_coordinator:
true`, and `original_agent_id_field`. Alias ids are schema drift and prevent a
clean `PASS` unless superseded or replaced.

All runtime receipts and ledgers used for validation must carry timestamp
evidence. Scout result receipts and stage result/review receipts must include
`created_at_utc` and `completed_at_utc`. Dispatch ledger entries must include
`dispatched_at_utc`, `recorded_before_wait: true`, and, once known,
`receipt_observed_at_utc` and `accepted_at_utc` or `superseded_at_utc`. Review
ordering must be provable from both dependency fields and timestamps; relying
only on transcript order caps the verdict at `PASS_WITH_CONCERNS`.

Runtime child prompts and stage briefs must include an explicit scope-hygiene
rule: children are subagents with curated runtime context. The validation read
model is blacklist-first. A child may inspect current-run artifacts that are
directly relevant to its assigned stage or to the executor/reviewer output it is
judging, including generated provenance when that provenance is part of the
deliverable contract. It should not read external workflow/plugin skill files,
development-plane docs, progress docs, Task 10 plans, archive evidence, or
prior-run diagnostics unless a brief explicitly allows that forbidden class.
Runtime-facing prompts and briefs should avoid naming project-development
workflow frameworks unless the child truly needs them for the assigned stage. If
the host platform injects unavoidable startup/plugin instructions, the child may
obey only the minimal stop/skip behavior required by that platform, but it must
not use those external workflow skills as task context. A platform-mandated
startup read with no task influence is an environment limitation to record, not
by itself a clean-PASS blocker. Actively reading or applying external workflow
skills, AutoStudy validation plans, development docs, prior diagnostics, or
archive evidence as task sources is a process concern or failure depending on
impact; reading prior AutoStudy validation or archive evidence is a failure.

The Main Agent A owns transcript collection for the review phase. If B could not
export child transcripts directly, A acts only as a mechanical transcript export
broker before review: locate each raw transcript body, copy it unchanged under
`transcripts/`, and record provenance. A must not replace D/E's semantic review
by reading and judging every child trajectory itself. Once transcripts are
exported, D owns the independent process review and must dispatch one auditor
child E per available runtime child transcript, including pre-alignment scout,
executor, reviewer, fix, and repair children. A final trajectory verdict that
does not include auditor-child review of available runtime child transcript
bodies is incomplete.

D and E have different audit scopes:

- D, the trajectory review coordinator, audits process organization and coverage.
  D reads the coordinator summary/transcript, dispatch ledger, transcript
  inventory, explore manifest, scout result index, stage brief/result/review
  indexes, and E audit receipts. D should not default to reading every child
  transcript body end to end; D may inspect transcript bodies only for sampling,
  anomalies, or high-risk contradictions.
- E, a transcript-auditor child, audits one runtime child C in depth. Each E
  receives exactly one C transcript body plus that C's initial prompt or
  dispatch request, scout/stage brief, required tool docs when available, and
  receipt.
  E first derives that child's instruction contract, then decides whether the
  transcript supports the receipt and whether C stayed within the contract.

D must not replace E audits with a receipt-only summary. E must not broaden its
scope to audit the whole run. This division keeps the review scalable while
preserving transcript-body evidence.

## Post-Run Process Review

Every iteration must review the process, not just the artifact quality:

- Did the coordinator follow the declared entry preset and startup inventory?
- Did the coordinator enable and skip non-source explore scouts according to the
  startup inventory, and did it record scout results or skip reasons in
  `investigation/explore_manifest.json` before alignment?
- Did every dispatched non-source pre-alignment scout appear in
  `stage_reviews/child_dispatch_ledger.json`, have a receipt under
  `investigation/_appendix/scout_receipts/` or an equivalent manifest-listed
  appendix path, and feed only distilled findings into
  `investigation/explore_context.md`?
- Did any retained startup file leak previous conclusions or receipts?
- Did child subagent trajectories match their declared stage and role?
- Was the `reference_collector` dispatch recorded in
  `stage_reviews/child_dispatch_ledger.json` with a real child identity? A
  handwritten alias such as `reference_collector_<course>_<assignment>` is not
  clean evidence. An empty dispatch ledger cannot prove
  `reference_collector_used: true`.
- Did any child write to coordinator-owned ledgers or other forbidden files?
- Did any transport recovery occur, and if so was it justified by receipt plus
  transcript evidence rather than accepted from a final message alone?
- Did child receipts avoid alias ids and either record exact `agent_id` values
  or explicit null-plus-authority identity fields?
- Did receipts and dispatch ledger entries include timestamps sufficient to
  prove ordering?
- Did child transcripts stay within allowed runtime reads and avoid external
  workflow/plugin skill influence, development-plane scope drift, or archive
  evidence leakage? If unavoidable platform startup reads occurred, did the
  transcript show that they were not used as task context?
- Did reviewers catch workflow-design problems, not only content mistakes?
- Were blocking `auto_fixable` issues repaired before final handoff, and were
  optional polish items kept separate from repair-required blockers?
- Were skipped stages represented by explicit `SKIPPED` result receipts and
  review `SKIP` receipts?
- Were transcript exports attempted by the direct parent coordinator whenever
  the tool surface allowed it?
- If the direct parent coordinator could not export child transcripts, did the
  Main Agent attempt a post-run transcript collector fallback using the stable
  child ids/transcript handles from the dispatch ledger?
- Did the trajectory review coordinator dispatch auditor children for every
  available runtime child transcript body, including explore scouts and
  execution/review children?
- Did D keep coordinator-level process review separate from E's one-child
  transcript-body audits?

These checks apply when swapping DSAA2011 for any later validation assignment.
The task can change; the launch hygiene, no-leak rule, child trajectory audit,
and repair-before-handoff rule do not.

## Transcript Collector Fallback

Full transcript export has two chances in development validation:

1. **Direct-parent export first.** The coordinator that dispatched a child
   subagent should export that child's full transcript before closing it when a
   read/export-thread tool is exposed to that coordinator.
2. **Main-thread collector fallback.** If the coordinator records
   `transcript_export_path: null` because it lacked a read/export-thread tool,
   the Main Agent must try a post-run collector using the stable child ids or
   transcript handles from `child_dispatch_ledger.json`.

For Codex app validation, there are two different id domains:

- `codex_app.read_thread` accepts Codex app thread ids. These are used by normal
  Codex app threads and the inspectable Codex-thread harness.
- `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent` returns multi-agent agent ids. Current probes show
  these ids work with `multi_agent_v1.wait_agent` / `resume_agent` for final
  status/output, but are rejected by `codex_app.read_thread` with invalid
  arguments and are not discoverable through `codex_app.list_threads`.

Therefore, when Task 10 uses ordinary `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent`, the
Main-thread collector fallback is local-session export, not `read_thread` by
agent id. For each propagated `agent_id`, locate exactly one
`.codex/sessions/**/<timestamp>-<agent_id>.jsonl` file, copy it unchanged under
`transcripts/`, and record the source path, line count, and exact-match rule in
`transcripts/transcript_inventory.json`. Do not use fuzzy `rg ... | head -1`
matching; ambiguous or missing session files are collector failures.

When the propagated id is a Codex app thread id, `read_thread` collection must
paginate. A single `read_thread` call may return only the most recent turns and
can therefore capture only the final/finalize exchange. The collector must
follow older-page cursors until no cursor remains, or until it has evidence that
the thread's initial assignment prompt and all visible intermediate messages
have been captured. Record pagination status in
`transcripts/transcript_inventory.json` for every exported coordinator, child,
and auditor thread.

When fallback succeeds, write each exported transcript to:

```text
transcripts/<unit_id>_<role>_<agent_id>.jsonl
```

Then update or sidecar the relevant receipt/ledger evidence with
`transcript_export_path`. The trajectory review coordinator must then dispatch
one transcript-body auditor child per available transcript. Only when both the
direct-parent export and main-thread collector fallback fail may the run record
`NO_FULL_CHILD_TRANSCRIPT_EXPORTS_AVAILABLE` and cap the verdict at
`PASS_WITH_CONCERNS`.

Transcript-auditor children must derive a child-specific instruction contract
before judging. The contract comes from the child's initial prompt, dispatch
request, scout/stage brief, required reads, required tool docs, receipt/trace schema,
role/stage boundary, task-relevant current-run read scope, forbidden
reads/actions, allowed writes, forbidden writes, and finalization protocol. E
then checks whether the transcript followed that contract. E should not treat a
directly relevant current-run artifact read as a concern merely because the
brief did not enumerate that exact file; the concern is reading a forbidden
class such as archive/prior-run/development evidence, or using host-injected
workflow context as task evidence. Generic safety checks such as forbidden
Canvas submission, role bleed, unsupported receipt claims, and unexplained
evidence limitations remain fallback checks, but the primary rubric is the
child's own instruction contract.

The trajectory review coordinator must check at least:

- declared iteration mode and the context/launch contract for that mode;
- coordinator identity and child-dispatch identity consistency;
- explore-scout coverage against startup inventory, including skipped-scout
  reasons, scout receipt paths, and whether `explore_context.md` is grounded in
  current scout results rather than hidden prior evidence;
- ledger coverage for normal, superseded, standby, replacement, repair, and
  skipped attempts;
- transcript inventory coverage for every auditable child;
- one E audit receipt per available child transcript;
- repair-before-handoff handling for blocking `auto_fixable` issues;
- spec-review before quality-review ordering;
- explicit `SKIPPED` receipts when conditional stages do not run;
- artifact-quality workflow concerns surfaced by the current task/run;
- final verdict support from E receipts and coordinator-level process evidence.

When fallback fails, the failure evidence must be machine-readable. Write
`transcripts/transcript_inventory.json` with every ledger child id, role,
receipt path, and collector status. Prefer a per-child read/list attempt. If
the platform rejects the id format at the tool boundary, try the local-session
JSONL exact-match export before declaring the child unavailable. The inventory
must name sampled ids, tool errors, local-session search patterns, and the reason
any remaining children inherit the same `not_exported` status.

## Inspectable Thread Harness For Clean PASS

If a development validation run is expected to reach a clean transcript-body
`PASS`, do not use a child-dispatch surface whose children cannot be exported or
read by either direct-parent export, Codex app `read_thread`, or local-session
JSONL exact-match export. Use
`docs/inspectable-subagent-transcript-harness.md` or an equivalent platform
transcript export API only when ordinary child ids cannot be propagated and
their local sessions cannot be exported.

The inspectable harness dispatches each scout/executor/reviewer as a readable
Codex thread, keeps it active at `READY_FOR_TRANSCRIPT_EXPORT`, exports
`codex_app.read_thread` output under `transcripts/`, records a child-written
trace bundle, and only then finalizes the child. This remains a fallback harness
for platforms or tool surfaces where ordinary nested child ids cannot be read.
