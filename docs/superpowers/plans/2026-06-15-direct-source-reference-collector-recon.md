# Direct-Source Reference Collector Recon Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Replace the normal homework reconnaissance source-scout pipeline with an always-on `reference_collector` that preserves complete original task sources under `references/`, then validate the flow with a fresh UCUG1808 proposal reconnaissance run through `[A]`.

**Architecture:** Keep `assignment-recon.md` as the broad Canvas raw snapshot workflow, add announcements to Stage 1, and make `reference_collector` the only child role for narrowing and preserving source evidence. The collector writes full original files or verbatim Canvas-native source copies plus `references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md`; the Main Agent reads references and writes terminal reconnaissance artifacts. Normal runs no longer create `reading_plan.compact.json`, `source_findings.compact.md`, or source-scout appendix files.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown runtime policy docs, Python `pytest` policy tests, local Canvas CLI commands documented in `canvascli-api.md`, git for checkpoint commits.

## File Structure

Modify these files:

- `tests/test_source_body_audit_policy.py`  
  Rewrite source reconnaissance policy tests from scout-chain assertions to direct-source reference collector assertions.

- `sub-skills/tasks/do-homework.md`  
  Update the `[A]` coordinator contract, workbench shape, `[A3]` rules, `[B]` summary rules, and pre-`[B]` completion checklist.

- `sub-skills/tools/assignment-recon.md`  
  Update Stage 1-5 to include announcements, always dispatch `reference_collector`, preserve references, copy Canvas-native source blocks verbatim, and remove source-scout artifacts as normal outputs.

- `skill.md`  
  Update the top-level Homework/Drafting source-of-truth chain and Main Agent read boundary.

- `docs/runtime-agent-protocol.md`  
  Replace `metadata_scout`/`content_scout` source taxonomy with `reference_collector` and update artifact/read boundaries.

- `sub-skills/tools/canvascli-api.md`  
  Update the Canvas Generic recipe to include announcements and the reference collector flow.

- `docs/development-validation-standard.md`  
  Update validation criteria from source-scout evidence to reference collector evidence.

- `sub-skills/tasks/task-orchestrator.md`  
  Update downstream source-read guidance to use `references/` and `references/canvas_native/` instead of `source_findings.compact.md`.

- `docs/PITFALLS.md`  
  Replace the old scout-chain warning with the direct-source reference collector failure mode and correct practice.

Create or update no production Python modules in this plan. This is a runtime-contract documentation and validation change.

### Task 0: Clean Interrupted WIP Before Implementation

**Files:**
- Restore: `docs/development-validation-standard.md`
- Restore: `docs/runtime-agent-protocol.md`
- Restore: `skill.md`
- Restore: `sub-skills/tasks/do-homework.md`
- Restore: `sub-skills/tools/assignment-recon.md`
- Restore: `sub-skills/tools/canvascli-api.md`
- Restore: `tests/test_source_body_audit_policy.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm current dirty files are only the interrupted pre-plan WIP**

Run:

```bash
git status --short --untracked-files=all
```

Expected: the dirty files are exactly the seven files listed above. The committed design spec and this implementation plan should not be dirty.

- [ ] **Step 2: Restore the interrupted WIP**

Run:

```bash
git restore \
  docs/development-validation-standard.md \
  docs/runtime-agent-protocol.md \
  skill.md \
  sub-skills/tasks/do-homework.md \
  sub-skills/tools/assignment-recon.md \
  sub-skills/tools/canvascli-api.md \
  tests/test_source_body_audit_policy.py
```

Expected: these files return to the committed baseline before the direct-source implementation begins.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify a clean implementation starting point**

Run:

```bash
git status --short --untracked-files=all
```

Expected: no dirty runtime/test files remain, except this plan file if it has not already been committed.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit only the plan if it is not already committed**

Run:

```bash
git add docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-15-direct-source-reference-collector-recon.md
git commit -m "Plan direct-source reference collector recon"
```

Expected: a commit containing only this plan file. If the plan has already been committed, skip this step.

### Task 1: Rewrite Policy Tests For Direct-Source Reference Collector

**Files:**
- Modify: `tests/test_source_body_audit_policy.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Replace scout-chain tests with collector tests**

Edit `tests/test_source_body_audit_policy.py` so the source reconnaissance tests assert the new contract. Replace the current tests that require `metadata_scout`, `content_scout`, `reading_plan.compact.json`, `source_findings.compact.md`, source index appendix, or body evidence fragments with these tests:

```python
def test_assignment_recon_uses_reference_collector_and_announcements():
    text = read("sub-skills/tools/assignment-recon.md")

    assert "reference_collector" in text
    assert "canvas/announcements.json" in text
    assert "references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md" in text
    assert "references/canvas_native/" in text
    assert "copy" in text
    assert "verbatim" in text
    assert "references/**/*.pdf.links.json" in text
    assert "references/syllabus/" not in text


def test_do_homework_defines_direct_source_reference_boundary():
    text = read("sub-skills/tasks/do-homework.md")

    assert "reference_collector" in text
    assert "references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md" in text
    assert "references/canvas_native/" in text
    assert "Main Agent" in text
    assert "complete original" in text
    assert "Do not create `reading_plan.compact.json`" in text
    assert "Do not create `source_findings.compact.md`" in text
    assert "Subagents must not write final `spec.md`" in text
    assert "proposal/research/open-ended" in text


def test_standard_homework_recon_removes_source_scout_pipeline():
    policy_text = "\n".join(
        [
            read("skill.md"),
            read("sub-skills/tasks/do-homework.md"),
            read("sub-skills/tools/assignment-recon.md"),
            read("docs/runtime-agent-protocol.md"),
        ]
    )

    assert "source_scout_pipeline_used" in policy_text
    assert "source_scout_pipeline_used\": false" in policy_text or '"source_scout_pipeline_used": false' in policy_text
    assert "metadata_scout -> reading_plan.compact.json -> content_scout -> source_findings.compact.md" not in policy_text
    assert "must dispatch real child subagents with" not in policy_text
    assert "Do not dispatch `content_scout` until `metadata_scout` has produced" not in policy_text


def test_reference_collector_preserves_canvas_native_sources_verbatim():
    policy_text = "\n".join(
        [
            read("sub-skills/tools/assignment-recon.md"),
            read("sub-skills/tasks/do-homework.md"),
            read("docs/runtime-agent-protocol.md"),
        ]
    )

    assert "references/canvas_native/" in policy_text
    assert "source.json" in policy_text
    assert "source.txt" in policy_text
    assert "ORIGIN.md" in policy_text
    assert "verbatim" in policy_text
    assert "must not summarize" in policy_text or "must not paraphrase" in policy_text


def test_main_agent_reads_references_not_old_source_findings():
    policy_text = "\n".join(
        [
            read("skill.md"),
            read("sub-skills/tasks/do-homework.md"),
            read("sub-skills/tasks/task-orchestrator.md"),
            read("docs/runtime-agent-protocol.md"),
        ]
    )

    assert "references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md" in policy_text
    assert "references/source_docs/" in policy_text
    assert "references/canvas_native/" in policy_text
    assert "source_findings.compact.md" not in policy_text
    assert "parent_source_read_requests" not in policy_text


def test_reference_collector_review_fields_are_documented():
    policy_text = "\n".join(
        [
            read("sub-skills/tools/assignment-recon.md"),
            read("sub-skills/tasks/do-homework.md"),
            read("docs/runtime-agent-protocol.md"),
        ]
    )

    assert '"announcements_checked": true' in policy_text
    assert '"reference_collector_used": true' in policy_text
    assert '"source_scout_pipeline_used": false' in policy_text
    assert '"reference_index_checked": true' in policy_text
    assert '"canvas_native_sources": []' in policy_text
    assert '"downloaded_references": []' in policy_text
    assert '"pdf_link_manifests_checked": true' in policy_text
```

Keep unrelated tests that still apply, such as UCUG1808 appearing only in historical acceptance design docs and recon summary depth behavior. Remove or rewrite assertions that require old scout artifacts.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests and verify RED**

Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_source_body_audit_policy.py -q
```

Expected: FAIL. Failures should point to missing `reference_collector`, `canvas/announcements.json`, `references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md`, `references/canvas_native/`, or old source-scout text still present.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit the failing tests**

Run:

```bash
git add tests/test_source_body_audit_policy.py
git commit -m "test: define reference collector recon policy"
```

Expected: commit contains only `tests/test_source_body_audit_policy.py`.

---

### Task 2: Update Top-Level Skill And Do-Homework Coordinator Contract

**Files:**
- Modify: `skill.md`
- Modify: `sub-skills/tasks/do-homework.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Update `skill.md` Homework/Drafting section**

In `skill.md`, update the source-of-truth chain to remove `reading_plan.compact.json` and `source_findings.compact.md`, and add:

```text
-> references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md
-> references/source_docs/ and references/canvas_native/
```

Add this contract:

```md
Standard homework reconnaissance always uses `reference_collector` after the
Canvas raw snapshot. The collector narrows task-relevant sources and preserves
complete original evidence under `references/`. It may download files, extract
PDF text, preserve PDF link annotations, and copy Canvas-native source JSON
blocks verbatim into `references/canvas_native/`.

The collector must not interpret the assignment, summarize requirements as the
only evidence path, or write final reconnaissance artifacts. The Main Agent
reads `references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md`, preserved reference files, and
Canvas-native `source.json` / `source.txt` copies before writing `spec.md`,
`rubric.md`, `review_a.json`, `recon_summary.md`, and `explore_context.md`.

Do not create `reading_plan.compact.json`, `reading_plan.compact.approved.json`,
`source_findings.compact.md`, source index appendix files, source body fragments,
or source scout receipts in standard runs.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Update `do-homework.md` required artifact chain**

In `sub-skills/tasks/do-homework.md`, set the `[A]` required chain to:

```text
prelaunch_startup_inventory.json
-> investigation/explore_manifest.json
-> investigation/explore_context.md
-> references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md
-> references/
   -> source_docs/<slug>/<slug>.pdf + .pdf.txt + .pdf.links.json
   -> slides/<slug>/<slug>.pptx + .pptx.txt
   -> external/<slug>.txt
   -> canvas_native/<slug>/source.json + source.txt + ORIGIN.md
-> investigation/recon_summary.md
-> spec.md
-> investigation/rubric.md
-> investigation/review_a.json
-> investigation/alignment_brief.md
-> pipeline_design.md
   -> Pipeline Review Status: awaiting_user_review
-> result.json
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Update `do-homework.md` actor rules**

Replace old source-scout actor rules with:

```md
- `reference_collector` is the only standard homework reconnaissance child role.
  It is a preservation worker, not a source judge.
- The Main Agent owns final source interpretation, `spec.md`, `rubric.md`,
  `review_a.json`, `recon_summary.md`, `explore_context.md`, user alignment,
  pipeline approval, and Canvas submission decisions.
- Subagents must not write final `spec.md`, final `review_a.json`,
  `pipeline_design.md`, or user alignment decisions.
- Normal runs must not create `reading_plan.compact.json`,
  `source_findings.compact.md`, or source-scout appendix files.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Update `[A3]` and pre-`[B]` completion rules**

In `do-homework.md [A3]`, require:

```md
1. Fetch raw Canvas snapshots through `assignment-recon.md`.
2. Dispatch `reference_collector` for every homework run.
3. Wait for `references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md`.
4. Read preserved references, not broad raw Canvas snapshots.
5. Write terminal artifacts.
```

Before `[B]`, require:

```md
- `references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md` exists.
- `references/canvas_native/` contains verbatim source copies for relevant
  Canvas-native syllabus, announcement, assignment page, or Canvas page content.
- PDFs that affect the assignment have original PDF, `.pdf.txt`, and
  `.pdf.links.json` companions.
- `review_a.json` records `reference_collector_used: true`,
  `source_scout_pipeline_used: false`, `announcements_checked`,
  `reference_index_checked`, `downloaded_references`, `canvas_native_sources`,
  and `pdf_link_manifests_checked`.
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run targeted tests**

Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_source_body_audit_policy.py::test_do_homework_defines_direct_source_reference_boundary tests/test_source_body_audit_policy.py::test_main_agent_reads_references_not_old_source_findings -q
```

Expected: these tests still FAIL until `assignment-recon.md`, runtime protocol, and downstream docs are updated; failures should no longer be due to `skill.md` or `do-homework.md`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit coordinator docs**

Run:

```bash
git add skill.md sub-skills/tasks/do-homework.md
git commit -m "docs: route homework recon through reference collector"
```

Expected: commit includes only `skill.md` and `sub-skills/tasks/do-homework.md`.

---

### Task 3: Update Assignment-Recon Reference Collector Workflow

**Files:**
- Modify: `sub-skills/tools/assignment-recon.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Update workbench contract**

In `sub-skills/tools/assignment-recon.md`, change the workbench tree so `canvas/` includes:

```text
announcements.json
```

Change `references/` to include:

```text
references/
├── REFERENCE_INDEX.md
├── source_docs/
├── slides/
├── external/
├── canvas_native/
│   └── <slug>/
│       ├── source.json
│       ├── source.txt
│       └── ORIGIN.md
└── pdf_links.json
```

Remove `reading_plan.compact.json`, `source_findings.compact.md`, `source_index.json`, `body_evidence_fragments/`, and `scout_receipts/` from the normal workbench tree.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add announcements to Stage 1 commands**

Add this command to Stage 1:

```bash
.venv/bin/canvascli announcements > "<work_dir>/canvas/announcements.json"
```

Document that 0 announcements is a valid checked state and that command failure is recorded in `investigation/unreachable.txt` plus `review_a.json`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Replace Source Candidate And Body Audit section**

Replace the old section beginning `### Source Candidate And Body Audit` with:

```md
### Reference Collector

Always dispatch `reference_collector` after Stage 1 raw Canvas snapshots.

The collector reads raw Canvas snapshots and preserves task-relevant source
evidence under `references/`. It does not write `spec.md`, `rubric.md`,
`review_a.json`, `source_findings.compact.md`, or `reading_plan.compact.json`.

Classifications for `references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md`:

```text
direct_spec | rubric_source | syllabus_constraint | required_input |
announcement_update | supporting_only | irrelevant | forbidden_or_stale | blocked
```

The collector downloads file references only when they are direct specs, rubric
sources, required inputs, announcement updates, or directly required supporting
sources. It must not download every course file.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Add Canvas-native preservation contract**

Add:

```md
When task-relevant information lives in Canvas-native JSON, copy the relevant
object verbatim to:

```text
references/canvas_native/<slug>/source.json
references/canvas_native/<slug>/source.txt
references/canvas_native/<slug>/ORIGIN.md
```

`source.json` must be copied from the raw Canvas snapshot without paraphrase. If
the raw JSON has no safe section boundary, copy the complete source object.
Announcement arrays are collection snapshots, not source objects; do not copy the
full `canvas/announcements.json` array into one
`references/canvas_native/announcements/source.json`. Preserve each screened,
task-relevant announcement as
`references/canvas_native/announcement-<id-or-slug>/source.json` with raw origin
`canvas/announcements.json#id=...`.
`source.txt` is an exact body-text export when available. `ORIGIN.md` may record
origin, copied object id, classification, and selection reason, but must not
summarize requirements.
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Preserve PDF companion rule**

Keep the existing PDF link annotation extraction section, but make it part of the collector contract. Ensure it still names both:

```text
references/<name>.pdf.links.json
references/**/*.pdf.links.json
```

and the three-layer source-adjacent pattern:

```text
<slug>.pdf
<slug>.pdf.txt
<slug>.pdf.links.json
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Update Stage 4 review JSON**

Replace old fields such as `compact_reading_plan_approved`, `source_findings_checked`, `required_high_signal_body_evidence_checked`, `appendix_paths`, and `parent_source_read_requests` with:

```json
{
  "assignment_shell_checked": true,
  "rubric_checked": true,
  "syllabus_checked": true,
  "announcements_checked": true,
  "reference_collector_used": true,
  "source_scout_pipeline_used": false,
  "reference_index_checked": true,
  "direct_spec_sources": [],
  "rubric_sources": [],
  "required_inputs": [],
  "canvas_native_sources": [],
  "relevant_announcements": [],
  "downloaded_references": [],
  "pdf_link_manifests_checked": true,
  "blocked_sources": [],
  "forbidden_or_stale_sources": [],
  "supporting_sources_skipped": [],
  "inputs_complete": true,
  "parent_self_check_complete": true,
  "verdict": "proceed"
}
```

Non-empty `review_a.json.relevant_announcements` entries must all be preserved
`references/canvas_native/announcement-<id-or-slug>/source.json` paths. When no
announcement is relevant, `relevant_announcements` must be `[]`.
`reference_collector_used: true` must be backed by a real
`stage_reviews/child_dispatch_ledger.json` row with `"role":
"reference_collector"` and either `"agent_id"` or `"transcript_handle"`, not
only by an `explore_manifest.json` status summary or a handwritten alias.

- [ ] **Step 7: Run targeted tests**

Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_source_body_audit_policy.py::test_assignment_recon_uses_reference_collector_and_announcements tests/test_source_body_audit_policy.py::test_reference_collector_preserves_canvas_native_sources_verbatim tests/test_source_body_audit_policy.py::test_reference_collector_review_fields_are_documented -q
```

Expected: PASS for these tests after this task.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit assignment recon docs**

Run:

```bash
git add sub-skills/tools/assignment-recon.md
git commit -m "docs: define assignment reference collector"
```

Expected: commit includes only `sub-skills/tools/assignment-recon.md`.

---

### Task 4: Update Runtime, Tool, Validation, Pitfall, And Orchestrator Docs

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/runtime-agent-protocol.md`
- Modify: `sub-skills/tools/canvascli-api.md`
- Modify: `docs/development-validation-standard.md`
- Modify: `sub-skills/tasks/task-orchestrator.md`
- Modify: `docs/PITFALLS.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Update runtime protocol source taxonomy**

In `docs/runtime-agent-protocol.md`, replace the source/spec child role model with:

```md
- source/spec exploration domain: the Main Agent owns source/spec judgment.
- reference_collector: always-on preservation child for homework reconnaissance.
  It reads raw Canvas snapshots, narrows task-relevant source evidence, downloads
  files, copies Canvas-native JSON verbatim, and writes
  `references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md`.
- `reference_collector` must not write terminal reconnaissance artifacts or
  summarize source requirements as the evidence path.
```

Remove current-runtime requirements for `metadata_scout`, `content_scout`,
`reading_plan.compact.json`, `source_findings.compact.md`, source index appendix,
body evidence fragments, and source scout receipts.

- [ ] **Step 2: Update runtime workbench tree and read boundary**

In `docs/runtime-agent-protocol.md`, update the workbench tree to include `references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md`, `references/canvas_native/`, and `canvas/announcements.json`. Add:

```md
The Main Agent reads preserved references and terminal Canvas shells, not old
source-scout compact findings. `references/` is the source evidence interface.
`canvas/` remains durable raw evidence.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Update canvascli recipe**

In `sub-skills/tools/canvascli-api.md`, update the Canvas Generic recipe so it says:

```md
1. Calls atomic context commands: `assignment`, `rubric`, `front-page`,
   `syllabus`, `modules`, `module-items`, `page`, `file`,
   `assignment-files`, and `announcements`.
2. Stores raw CLI JSON under `<work_dir>/canvas/`.
3. Runs `reference_collector` to preserve task-relevant source evidence under
   `<work_dir>/references/`.
4. Writes `<work_dir>/spec.md` as the Main Agent reconnaissance report.
```

Remove the mature-pattern sentence that names `metadata_scout`, compact reading plans, `content_scout`, and compact source findings.

- [ ] **Step 4: Update development validation standard**

In `docs/development-validation-standard.md`, replace source-scout evidence requirements with:

```md
For clean-start proposal/research/open-ended homework, source/spec evidence is
complete only when:

- raw Canvas snapshots include assignment, rubric, syllabus, modules,
  module-items, assignment files, pages when relevant, file metadata, and
  announcements;
- `reference_collector` has produced `references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md`;
- task-relevant Canvas-native evidence is copied verbatim under
  `references/canvas_native/`;
- fetched PDFs include original file, extracted text, and link annotation
  manifest;
- Main Agent `review_a.json` records `reference_collector_used: true` and
  `source_scout_pipeline_used: false`.
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Update task orchestrator downstream reads**

In `sub-skills/tasks/task-orchestrator.md`, replace guidance that depends on `source_findings.compact.md` with:

```md
If a stage depends on assignment source details, include the relevant preserved
reference paths from `references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md` in the stage brief:
`references/source_docs/**`, `references/slides/**`, `references/external/**`,
or `references/canvas_native/**/source.json`. Do not rely on
`source_findings.compact.md` or old source-scout appendix files.
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Update pitfalls**

In `docs/PITFALLS.md`, replace the old UCUG1808 correct-practice paragraph with:

```md
Correct practice: `do-homework.md [A3]` must call agent-led
`tools/assignment-recon.md`. The flow fetches broad Canvas raw snapshots,
including announcements, then always runs `reference_collector` to preserve
task-relevant original source evidence under `references/`. The Main Agent
reads complete preserved references and writes terminal reconnaissance artifacts.
Do not revive `metadata_scout -> reading_plan.compact.json -> content_scout ->
source_findings.compact.md`.
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Run policy tests**

Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_source_body_audit_policy.py -q
```

Expected: PASS for the rewritten source body audit policy tests.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit runtime and downstream docs**

Run:

```bash
git add docs/runtime-agent-protocol.md sub-skills/tools/canvascli-api.md docs/development-validation-standard.md sub-skills/tasks/task-orchestrator.md docs/PITFALLS.md
git commit -m "docs: update runtime for reference collector recon"
```

Expected: commit contains only these five docs.

---

### Task 5: Run Full Policy Test Suite

**Files:**
- No edits expected.

- [ ] **Step 1: Run source recon policy tests**

Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_source_body_audit_policy.py -q
```

Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run PDF link policy tests**

Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_pdf_link_annotation_policy.py -q
```

Expected: PASS. If this fails because old doc wording changed, update only policy text or tests needed to preserve the existing PDF three-layer companion requirement.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run hard requirement policy tests**

Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_spec_hard_requirement_policy.py -q
```

Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run all tests if the targeted suites pass**

Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

Expected: PASS, or only unrelated failures with clear explanation. Do not proceed to UCUG1808 runtime validation if source recon policy tests fail.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit any test/doc fixups**

If Task 5 required fixups, run:

```bash
git add tests docs sub-skills skill.md
git commit -m "test: align policy suites with reference collector recon"
```

Expected: commit contains only fixups needed for tests.

---

### Task 6: Fresh UCUG1808 Reconnaissance Validation Through `[A]`

**Files:**
- Runtime output under: `data/homework/UCUG1808-L01/`
- No source-code commit expected for generated homework data unless explicitly requested.

- [ ] **Step 1: Remove stale UCUG1808 workbench**

Run:

```bash
rm -rf data/homework/UCUG1808-L01
```

Expected: no `data/homework/UCUG1808-L01` directory remains.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run `do-homework` for UCUG1808 Project Proposal Files through `[A]` only**

Use the `do-homework` skill in this repository for:

```text
Course: UCUG1808-L01
Assignment: Project Proposal Files
Stop point: after `[A]` reconnaissance, before `[B]` user alignment
```

Expected behavior:

- `assignment-recon.md` runs Stage 1 raw Canvas snapshot collection.
- `canvas/announcements.json` is fetched or a failure is recorded.
- `reference_collector` runs for the assignment.
- The run stops after `[A]` and does not draft or submit.

- [ ] **Step 3: Inspect forbidden old artifacts**

Run:

```bash
find data/homework/UCUG1808-L01 -path '*reading_plan.compact*' -o -path '*source_findings.compact.md' -o -path '*_appendix/source_index.json' -o -path '*_appendix/body_evidence_fragments*' -o -path '*_appendix/scout_receipts*'
```

Expected: no output. If output appears, the implementation is not complete.

- [ ] **Step 4: Inspect required reference collector artifacts**

Run:

```bash
find data/homework/UCUG1808-L01 -maxdepth 5 \( -path '*references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md' -o -path '*references/canvas_native/*/source.json' -o -path '*references/source_docs/*/*.pdf' -o -path '*references/source_docs/*/*.pdf.txt' -o -path '*references/source_docs/*/*.pdf.links.json' \) | sort
```

Expected:

- one `references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md`;
- at least one `references/canvas_native/**/source.json` for syllabus, announcement if relevant, assignment/page if relevant, or other Canvas-native task evidence;
- if announcements are relevant, each preserved announcement is an individual
  `references/canvas_native/announcement-<id-or-slug>/source.json`, not a full
  `canvas/announcements.json` mirror;
- proposal direct-spec PDF or equivalent source file under `references/source_docs/`;
- matching `.pdf.txt` and `.pdf.links.json` for every fetched spec-impacting PDF.

- [ ] **Step 5: Inspect terminal reconnaissance artifacts**

Run:

```bash
find data/homework/UCUG1808-L01 -maxdepth 4 \( -name spec.md -o -name rubric.md -o -name review_a.json -o -name recon_summary.md -o -name explore_context.md -o -name explore_manifest.json -o -name unreachable.txt \) | sort
```

Expected: `spec.md`, `investigation/rubric.md`, `investigation/review_a.json`, `investigation/recon_summary.md`, `investigation/explore_context.md`, and `investigation/explore_manifest.json` exist.

- [ ] **Step 6: Validate `review_a.json` fields**

Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python - <<'PY'
import json
from pathlib import Path

root = Path("data/homework/UCUG1808-L01")
review_paths = list(root.glob("**/investigation/review_a.json"))
assert len(review_paths) == 1, review_paths
data = json.loads(review_paths[0].read_text())
required = {
    "assignment_shell_checked": True,
    "rubric_checked": True,
    "syllabus_checked": True,
    "announcements_checked": True,
    "reference_collector_used": True,
    "source_scout_pipeline_used": False,
    "reference_index_checked": True,
    "pdf_link_manifests_checked": True,
    "parent_self_check_complete": True,
}
missing = {k: (data.get(k), v) for k, v in required.items() if data.get(k) != v}
assert not missing, missing
assert data.get("direct_spec_sources"), "direct_spec_sources is empty"
assert data.get("downloaded_references"), "downloaded_references is empty"
for item in data.get("relevant_announcements", []):
    assert "references/canvas_native/announcement-" in item, item
assert "compact_reading_plan_approved" not in data
assert "source_findings_checked" not in data
print(review_paths[0])
PY
```

Then verify the real collector dispatch evidence:

```bash
.venv/bin/python - <<'PY'
import json
from pathlib import Path

root = Path("data/homework/UCUG1808-L01")
ledger_paths = list(root.glob("**/stage_reviews/child_dispatch_ledger.json"))
assert len(ledger_paths) == 1, ledger_paths
ledger = json.loads(ledger_paths[0].read_text())
collector_rows = [row for row in ledger if row.get("role") == "reference_collector"]
assert collector_rows, "missing reference_collector ledger row"
for row in collector_rows:
    assert row.get("agent_id") or row.get("transcript_handle"), row
print(ledger_paths[0])
PY
```

Expected: commands print the `review_a.json` path and the
`stage_reviews/child_dispatch_ledger.json` path, then exit 0.

- [ ] **Step 7: Validate reference index does not summarize source requirements**

Run:

```bash
sed -n '1,220p' "$(find data/homework/UCUG1808-L01 -path '*references/REFERENCE_INDEX.md' | head -1)"
```

Expected: index lists classification, reference path, raw origin, reason selected, and companions. It should not contain paragraph summaries of assignment requirements that replace reading the source.

- [ ] **Step 8: Record validation result**

Create a short validation note under:

```text
docs/verification/2026-06-15/ucug1808-reference-collector-recon.md
```

Include:

- command or exact prompt used to run `do-homework` to `[A]`;
- whether old source-scout artifacts were absent;
- required reference collector artifacts found;
- `review_a.json` field check result;
- any shortcomings observed in the generated workbench;
- whether the implementation is accepted or needs a follow-up patch.

- [ ] **Step 9: Commit validation note and any required flow fixes**

If the UCUG1808 run passes without source doc changes:

```bash
git add docs/verification/2026-06-15/ucug1808-reference-collector-recon.md
git commit -m "test: validate UCUG1808 reference collector recon"
```

If validation exposes runtime doc/test problems, fix those problems first, rerun Task 6 checks, then commit the fixes and validation note together:

```bash
git add docs/verification/2026-06-15/ucug1808-reference-collector-recon.md skill.md sub-skills docs tests
git commit -m "fix: harden reference collector recon validation"
```
