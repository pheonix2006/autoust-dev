# AutoStudy Development Guide

> Current homework default (2026-09-08): use `sub-skills/tasks/do-homework.md`.
> Complete course-source investigation before relevance filtering, a concise
> investigation summary and short plan, then free execution. No stage paperwork,
> phase approvals or separate repair pipelines. Contracts below describe legacy mode;
> they do not govern ordinary homework or override the current entrypoint.

> Entry + constraints for **developers** of AutoStudy. If you're using AutoStudy
> as a skill (i.e. you're an end-user agent loading it to do Canvas tasks), read
> [skill.md](../skill.md) instead.

## Who reads this

This file is for the next person (or agent) who picks up AutoStudy development — extending tasks, adding tools, fixing bugs. Two different audiences, two different entry points:

| Audience | Entry | Asks |
|---|---|---|
| **Skill user** (agent doing Canvas tasks for the user) | [`skill.md`](../skill.md) | "What can I do for this Canvas student right now?" |
| **Skill developer** (this file) | `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` | "How is this repo organized? What's the current state? Where do I write things?" |

If you only read `skill.md`, you'd think the repo is a runtime tool. Reading this file first tells you it's also an evolving project with its own roadmap, conventions, and verification rituals.

## Sister repo

The Canvas data layer (`canvascli`) lives at **`~/workspace/canvascli/`** (or wherever the user cloned it). It's a separate git repo, installed into AutoStudy's `.venv` via `pip install -e`. When you change Canvas access behavior, that work belongs in `canvascli/`, not here.

For the full three-project workflow, branch policy, verification rules, and
documentation-sync checklist, read `COLLABORATION.md`.

Layer boundary:

- `canvascli` is the data layer: Canvas login/session, REST API calls, pagination, course/assignment/file/announcement/submission commands, and stable JSON output.
- `autoust` is the application layer: skill routing, task orchestration, study/homework workflows, user confirmation points, and documentation for agents.

When a bug or feature request touches both, land the data-layer change in `canvascli` first, then update AutoStudy docs/tasks against the new CLI contract. For rapid development, keep both repos on the user's long-lived update branch (`codex/deepwisdom-updates`) and commit there; open a PR only when the user asks for review or release.

## Reference project

Canvas Copilot is the design reference for this project. Prefer the local clone at **`/Users/deepwisdom/Desktop/project/canvas_copilot`** when it exists; otherwise use the public repo [X-isdoingreat/Canvas_pilot_public](https://github.com/X-isdoingreat/Canvas_pilot_public). Before inventing a new Canvas workflow, inspect how Canvas Copilot solved similar problems, especially around deep assignment reconnaissance, submission safeguards, hooks, tests, and recurring automation.

AutoStudy's distilled notes live in `canvas-pilot-reference.md`. Treat that file as the first stop for "what should we borrow from Canvas Copilot?" and go to the source repo when implementation details matter.

Superpowers is the workflow reference for agent handoff discipline: brainstorm
before plans, plans before execution, fresh subagents with curated context, and
independent review before completion claims. It is a design reference, not a
runtime dependency. AutoStudy translates these practices into its own runtime
protocol in `docs/runtime-agent-protocol.md`.

Historical M3.5 staged homework direction is recorded in `COLLABORATION.md` and
`canvas-pilot-reference.md`: use agent-led Canvas Generic Stage 1-5
reconnaissance, write a standardized `spec.md`, keep `problem.md` only as
compatibility, run a post-recon alignment loop that writes confirmed
`investigation/alignment_brief.md`, and execute through `pipeline_design.md`
instead of `task_profile.yaml`.

Five design principles govern M3.5+ development (full text in
`COLLABORATION.md` -> Design Principles):

1. Assistant, not automation
2. Dynamic skills composition, no fixed pipelines
3. Multi-turn iteration (in-session resume + cross-session refinement)
4. Three-layer preference system (task / course / user)
5. Review-first design (composable sub-agent review per pipeline stage)

## Skills architecture

Skills are **domain expertise supplements** — not fixed pipeline scripts. The
complete spec is in **`skills-architecture-spec.md`**. Read that file before
modifying any skill or adding a new one.

Key rules:
- `_index.md` only lists top-level skills; sub-skills are discovered progressively
- Each skill follows a standard template: Contract → Guidance → Appendices →
  Post-processing → Self-check
- Skills compose via files in the workbench, not direct calls
- Language/type specifics go in appendix files, not the main skill or `_index.md`
- Defaults live in skill files; overrides come from confirmed
  `investigation/alignment_brief.md` plus `pipeline_design.md` (task),
  `data/course-overrides/` (course, not yet implemented), or Claude Code memory
  (user, not yet implemented)

## Start-of-session checklist

Run through these before touching code:

1. Read `docs/progress/agent-progress.md` — what just happened and where we left off
2. Read `docs/plans/feature-list.json` — the structured backlog with status
3. Check `git log --oneline | head -10` — recent commits across both repos (`AutoStudy` and `~/workspace/canvascli`)
4. Re-verify one or two recently-passed features by re-running them. If a regression slipped in, **flip status back to `untested` first**, then start work
5. Pick exactly one in-progress or pending feature to push forward

## End-of-session checklist

Don't close out a session without:

- [ ] Updating `docs/progress/agent-progress.md` (1–3 sentences on what changed and what's next)
- [ ] Updating the status of any feature you touched in `docs/plans/feature-list.json`
- [ ] Capturing verification evidence somewhere (in-line commit body, screenshot path noted, or `docs/verification/<date>/<topic>/` if substantial)
- [ ] No uncommitted changes (or if there are, explain in progress note why)

## Where things live

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Roadmap (the big picture) | [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) |
| Runtime agent handoff protocol | [runtime-agent-protocol.md](./runtime-agent-protocol.md) |
| Skill entry for end-users | [skill.md](../skill.md) at repo root |
| Marketing scenarios | [MARKETING.md](./MARKETING.md) |
| Burnt-once pitfalls | [PITFALLS.md](./PITFALLS.md) |
| Backlog with status | `docs/plans/feature-list.json` |
| Session handoff notes | `docs/progress/agent-progress.md` |
| Skill tool/task docs | `sub-skills/{tools,tasks}/*.md` |

We're deliberately **not** maintaining `docs/standards/` or `docs/adr/` yet. ROADMAP and PITFALLS already cover what they would, at this scale. Add them if/when they become genuinely needed (i.e. a new contributor can't ramp up without them).

## Rules of thumb

- **Verification before "passing"**: never flip a feature from in-progress to passing without something concrete to point to (a commit, a tested artifact, a screenshot).
- **Pitfalls go to `docs/PITFALLS.md` or the relevant sub-skill `.md`**, not into chat or commit messages. The next agent won't read your commit body.
- **Don't write features that require canvascli changes without confirming the canvascli repo state first.** They evolve together.
- **Repo > chat**: anything worth knowing twice goes to a file, not the conversation.

## Influences

The two-tier (entry / docs) layout follows the pattern in [Aurorra1123/ust-dev `harness-best-practice` skill](https://github.com/Aurorra1123/ust-dev/commit/59761756ebcd01d68a4b62729b4e03f09948dc63) — minus the parts that don't fit AutoStudy yet (`adr/`, `architecture/`, `verification/`, `exec-plan/`). We adopt only `progress/` and `plans/` for now; the rest is overhead at our current size.
